# Capture the Flag

The first thing we tried, was connecting to the server via telnet, but the connection was refused:

```bash
$ telnet ossec-host.cs.ru.nl
Trying 131.174.142.7...
telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused
```

Next we tried connecting via SSH, and there is indeed an SSH server running on the host, but connecting requires a password that we do not know:

```
$ ssh root@ossec-host.cs.ru.nl
root@ossec-host.cs.ru.nl's password:
Permission denied, please try again.
```
